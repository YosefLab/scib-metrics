-### Making a release
-
-#### Updating the version number
-
-Before making a release, you need to update the version number. Please adhere to [Semantic Versioning][semver], in brief
-
-> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
->
-> 1.  MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
-> 2.  MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
-> 3.  PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
->
-> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
-
-We use [bump2version][] to automatically update the version number in all places and automatically create a git tag.
-Run one of the following commands in the root of the repository
-
-```bash
-bump2version patch
-bump2version minor
-bump2version major
-```
-
-Once you are done, run
-
-```
-git push --tags
-```
-
-to publish the created tag on GitHub.

-#### Upload on PyPI
-
-Please follow the [Python packaging tutorial][].
-
-It is possible to automate this with GitHub actions, see also [this feature request][pypi-feature-request]
-in the cookiecutter-scverse template.

-### Writing documentation
-
-Please write documentation for your package. This project uses [sphinx][] with the following features:
-
--   the [myst][] extension allows to write documentation in markdown/Markedly Structured Text
--   [Numpy-style docstrings][numpydoc] (through the [napoloen][numpydoc-napoleon] extension).
--   Jupyter notebooks as tutorials through [myst-nb][] (See [Tutorials with myst-nb](#tutorials-with-myst-nb-and-jupyter-notebooks))
--   [Sphinx autodoc typehints][], to automatically reference annotated input and output types
+## Moving forward

-See the [scanpy developer docs](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/documentation.html) for more information
-on how to write documentation.
-
-### Tutorials with myst-nb and jupyter notebooks
-
-The documentation is set-up to render jupyter notebooks stored in the `docs/notebooks` directory using [myst-nb][].
-Currently, only notebooks in `.ipynb` format are supported that will be included with both their input and output cells.
-It is your reponsibility to update and re-run the notebook whenever necessary.
-
-If you are interested in automatically running notebooks as part of the continuous integration, please check
-out [this feature request](https://github.com/scverse/cookiecutter-scverse/issues/40) in the `cookiecutter-scverse`
-repository.
-
-#### Hints
-
--   If you refer to objects from other packages, please add an entry to `intersphinx_mapping` in `docs/conf.py`. Only
-    if you do so can sphinx automatically create a link to the external documentation.
--   If building the documentation fails because of a missing link that is outside your control, you can add an entry to
-    the `nitpick_ignore` list in `docs/conf.py`
-
-#### Building the docs locally
-
-```bash
-cd docs
-make html
-open _build/html/index.html
-```
